Quick Start Guide,Implement the business logic,"Developing an API involves writing the business logic for it. APIs often need to integrate with third-party systems to create a comprehensive integration solution. With Choreo, you can create your integration solution easily by implementing the business logic using its low-code editor, pro-code editor, or both.

### Step 1: Develop in low-code
Follow this procedure to further develop the API by adding a new resource and simple business logic:
1. Click **Overview** in the left navigation menu.
2. Click **Edit Code**. 
    !!! info
        The Web Editor can take some time to open if you are a first-time user.
3. Click **+** below the low-code diagram to add a new resource and configure it as follows: 
**HTTP Method** | `GET`
**Resource Path** | `personalizedMessage`
**Return Type** | `string | error`
4. Click **+ Add Parameter** to add a query parameter.  Enter the following values to get a name as input:
**Type** | `string` 
**Param Name** | `name`
5. Click **Save** to save the query parameter, and then click **Save** again to save the resource.
6. In the low-code diagram, click **+** after **Start**. In the **Add Constructs** pane, click **Variable**.
7. Update the given variable statement syntax (i.e., **`var variable = <add-expression>`**) to generate a personalized message by following these steps:
    1. To generate the message in string format, click **`var`**, and click **string**.
    2. Double-click **`variable`** which is the default variable name to edit it. Enter `message` as the new variable name.
    3. To generate the personalized message, double-click **`<add-expression>`** and enter the following expression:
        ```
         ""Hello ""+ name
        ```
        Now the variable statement is updated as follows:
        ```
        string message = ""Hello ""+ name;
        ```
8. Click **Save**.
9. To return the personalized message, click **+** below the variable you created and click **Return**. In the **Return** pane, the return statement syntax is displayed as **`return <add-expression>`**. Click **`<add-expression`**, and click **message** in the list of suggestions that appear below the return statement syntax.   
10. Click **Save**.

Get Started with Choreo,Create and publish a new version of the REST API,"Currently, the updates to the `readinglist` REST API are saved only as long as the deployment status of the `readingList` API remains **Active**. If you undeploy and redeploy the `readingList` API, Choreo deploys it in a new container. Therefore you cannot retrieve the reading list with the updates you made after the last deployment. To persist the data even after undeploying and redeploying the REST API, let's connect it to a MySQL database. Then let's create and publish a new version of the REST API with the ability to persist the data to the MySQL database.

### Step 3.1: Create a new version of the REST API
Let's create a new version of the `readingList` REST API that can connect to a MySQL database on a cloud platform to persist data, and then redeploy it. To do this, follow the steps given below:
1. In the Choreo Console, open the `readingList` REST API (if it is not already open) and click the **Deploy** icon to open the **Deploy** tab.
2. Expand the list of versions and click **+ Create New**.
3. Select **version-2** as the associated GitHub branch and enter `2.0.0` as the version name. Next click **Create**.
    !!! info
        The `version-2` GitHub branch has another version of the REST API implementation with the required configurations to connect to the sample MySQL.
4. Click **Config & Deploy**.
5. For this scenario, you can connect to the pre-configured MySQL database on AWS. To do this, enter the following information in the **Configure & Deploy** pane:
    !!! info
        When you are connecting to an external database for a real-life use case, you are required to provision your database on a cloud platform. To allow Choreo to connect to the external database, it is important to add the relevant IPs to the allow list.For detailed instructions, see Access Your RDBMS Data Using Choreo (https://wso2.com/choreo/resources/access-your-rdbms-data-using-choreo/).
    **dbHost**     | `choreo-gsg-db.csobrmx6fi0k.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
    **dbUser**     | `admin`
    **dbPassword** | `qYy71wQaxfLlH4`
    **dbName**     | `reading_list_db`
    **dbPort**     | `3306`
7. Click **Deploy**.
Now you have successfully deployed a new version of your REST API.

### Step 3.2: Publish the new REST API version
To publish the new version of the REST API you created, repeat step Publish the REST API

### Step 3.3: Consume the new REST API version

Create Your First Webhook,Develop,"To create a project, add a Webhook component to it, design the webhook, test it, and then commit it to make it available in the Choreo Console, follow these sub-steps:

### Step 1.1: Create a project and add a Webhook component
First, let's add a Webhook component as follows:
1. Sign in to the Choreo Console at https://console.choreo.dev.
2. On the **Home** page, click **+ Create** Project.
3. Enter a unique project name and a description. For this tutorial, let's enter the following values:
**Name**        | `IssueTracking`
**Description** | `Track GitHub issues`
4. Click **Create**. This takes you to the **Components** page.
5. On the **Components** page, click **Create** on the **Webhook** card.
6. Provide authorization with your GitHub account by clicking  **Authorize with GitHub**. 
7. If you have not already authorized Choreo apps, click **Authorize Choreo Apps** when prompted.
8. Select a GitHub account, a repository that includes a Ballerina project or a Dockerfile, the relevant branch, and **Ballerina** as the build preset.  
9. Enter a valid path relative to the root of your repository that points to the implementation of the webhook. If you have not designed and implemented your webhook yet, you can connect an empty GitHub repository or a sub-folder and proceed to create the component. 
    !!! note
        If you connect an empty GitHub repository to create the component, you cannot deploy the component. Be sure to implement your webhook before proceeding to the deployment stage. 
10. Click **Next**.
10. In the **Create a Webhook** pane, click on the Webhook type you want to create, for example **GitHub**. 
11. Click **Create**.
    1. In the **Webhook Name** field, enter a unique webhook name (e.g., `IssueTracking`).
    2. From the **Trigger Channel** list, select **IssuesService** so that the system can trigger your webhook based on a change it observes in GitHub issues (i.e., assigning a label in this scenario).
    3. Click **Create**. The webhook opens on a separate page.
      
### Step 1.2: Design the webhook
Designing a webhook involves specifying how the webhook should function by adding and configuring the required connectors and statements. You can do this by editing the low-code diagram of the Webhookor by editing its code. You can implement your webhook in Ballerina or any other language and containerize it. You can use the Ballerina VS code extension (https://ballerina.io/downloads/) to develop the webhook in Ballerina. For example, you can use the following source code to design a webhook to read the labels of GitHub issues in a specific repository and generate an email notification for GitHub issues with the `bug` label. You can add this code in the .bal file in your repository.",713,"Title: Create Your First Webhook

REST is now widely used to create high-performance, stateless, and reliable APIs that are used by different applications."
REST APIs,Designing a REST API,"Designing a REST API is the process of declaring the resources, the appropriate HTTP verbs, paths, and input (request) and output (response) data formats to showcase the capabilities of the API. Designing an API based on a standard helps to do the design well and provide a consistent experience to the users of your API. The OpenAPI Specification (https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) is the most widely used standard for declaring HTTP/REST APIs. The design of an API is a crucial factor that determines the usability and the value of the API. A well-designed API is profitable due to the ease of adoption. Choreo’s low-code editor allows developers to design (and develop) high-quality REST APIs with ease. To design a REST API in Choreo, you must create a REST API component. You can design a REST API from scratch by manually specifying the resources, the HTTP verbs, paths, and other required elements. The Choreo roadmap also includes the capability to design a REST API by importing an OpenAPI document, which will be available soon.
Choreo allows you to design your REST API in three possible ways
- **Start from scratch**
    You can design a REST API via Choreo’s low-code editor that allows developers to design (and develop) high-quality REST APIs with ease. This method involves designing the REST API from scratch by manually specifying the resources, the HTTP verbs, paths, and other required elements.
    Choreo allows developers to easily specify input and output data formats for each API resource:
- **Connect existing Ballerina repository**
    If you have a REST API written in the Ballerina Programming Language (https://ballerina.io), you can deploy it in Choreo. To do this, you must save it in a private GitHub repository and connect that repository to Choreo.
- **Bring your Dockerfile**
  If you have an existing REST API written in any programming language, you can deploy it in Choreo. To do this, you must generate a Docker image for the REST API and save the Dockerfile in a private GitHub repository. When you connect this GitHub repository to Choreo, you can build the Dockerfile to pull the REST API implementation from the Docker image.",492,"Title: REST APIs
Heading: Designing a REST API
Choreo is a low-code editor which allows developers to design and develop high-quality REST APIs with ease. It provides three methods to design REST APIs: starting from scratch, connecting an existing Ballerina repository, and bringing a Dockerfile. The OpenAPI Specification is the most widely used standard for declaring HTTP/REST APIs and Choreo will soon include the capability to design a REST API by importing an OpenAPI document. Designing a well-structured API is essential for its usability and value and Choreo's low-code editor enables developers to do so with ease."
REST APIs,Developing a REST API,"Choreo supports spec-driven API development. Once you have carefully designed and defined your API, you can start implementing the functionality of your API. Choreo comes with an online IDE based on Visual Studio Code for developers to implement API functionality. With its support for both low-code and pro-code modes to implement APIs and the flexibility to alternate between the modes during development, Choreo makes API development easy, smooth, and developer-friendly.

### Low-code mode
The low-code programming model allows developers to use general programming constructs such as loops, conditional statements, variable declarations and assignments, logs, data transformations(visual data mapping), and more in a graphical editor. It also allows developers to connect to built-in or custom-developed connectors.
The main advantage of the low-code programming mode is that it can increase developer productivity multiple folds by eliminating the need to write complex code. As developers use constructs on the low-code editor to implement the API, the IDE automatically writes the corresponding Ballerina (https://ballerina.io/) source code for the API, which significantly speeds up the developer learning process and boosts overall productivity.

### Pro-code mode
The pro-code mode of Choreo allows developers to directly edit code in a manner where the graphical representation in the low-code editor gets updated accordingly. Choreo also allows viewing the low-code and pro-code editors side-by-side.
Choreo gives developers the flexibility to use the pro-code mode only or to use it for implementing specific parts of the API while using the low-code mode for the rest, based on their preference. Choreo treats the source code (generated and handwritten) as the single source of truth and has no limitations or restrictions on the mode you can choose to implement API functionality.",377,"Title: REST APIs
Heading: Developing a REST API

Choreo is a tool that helps developers build APIs quickly and efficiently with support for both low-code and pro-code modes.

A REST API Proxy helps you manage the API by applying necessary security policies, access-control policies, and even collecting analytics. Fronting your unmanaged API by a REST API proxy gives your application the flexibility to make changes to the backend API without affecting the applications that consume them.

It is a layer between the application and the API that adds security, rate-limiting, access-control, and analytics to the API. Keywords: REST API Proxy, Representational State Transfer (REST), security policies, access-control policies, analytics, endpoint, layer, application, API.

The text discusses the use of a REST API Proxy to manage an API by applying security policies, access-control policies, and collecting analytics. A REST API Proxy provides a layer between the application and the API and exposes an endpoint that applications use to consume the API. This allows applications to make changes to the backend API without affecting any other applications that consume it."
REST API Proxy,Develop a REST API Proxy,"Designing your REST API proxy from scratch involves declaring the resources and the methods the end-user applications will use to access the API. Choreo supports spec-driven API Proxy development. Therefore, it guides you visually via a Swagger editor to create REST API Proxies that comply with The Open API Specification (https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). It is the most widely used standard for declaring HTTP/REST APIs. Choreo also allows you to generate your OpenAPI specification through this editor.
Choreo allows you to easily expose your existing APIs via a REST API proxy and convert it to a managed API. You can create a REST API Proxy in Choreo in two ways:
- From scratch by using an existing endpoint 
- By importing an OpenAPI specification

### Designing a new REST API Proxy using an existing endpoint 
You can front your existing API with a REST API Proxy easily using Choreo. To design a new REST API Proxy, you need to create a REST API Proxy component and specify the API name, the base path, and the endpoint to create the basic API definition. Once Choreo creates the API definition, you can then define the resources by specifying the URI pattern, the HTTP methods, and optionally, any parameters:

### Designing a new REST API Proxy by importing an OpenAPI specification
Choreo allows you to create a REST API Proxy by importing an Open API Specification or providing an URL to the Open API specification. Choreo will then extract the API name, base path, and endpoint. Choreo gives you the flexibility to change this information as required. Once you create the API Proxy, you can modify it by defining the resources, URI pattern, HTTP methods, and any parameters (optional).
Once you create an API proxy in Choreo, you can access the API definition of that API. Choreo also exposes the endpoints for the API where it maintains two gateway environments, production, and sandbox.",418,"Title: REST API Proxy

Choreo is a platform that supports the development of REST API Proxies by guiding users through a Swagger editor to create APIs that comply with the OpenAPI Specification. It allows users to create an API Proxy from scratch with an existing endpoint or by importing an OpenAPI specification. Choreo also provides an API definition and gateway environments (production and sandbox) once an API Proxy has been created."
REST API Proxy,Deploying a REST API Proxy,"Choreo runs a professional, enterprise-grade CI/CD process to deploy APIs to its runtime(data plane) clusters. Under the hood, Choreo's data plane runs on a Kubernetes stack, hence benefits from all its features such as auto-scaling, auto-healing, secret management, liveness, readiness checks, and so on.
Once you deploy the REST API to the development environment, it is then exposed by an API Gateway with API security turned on. Developers get a testable URL for their API which they can use to verify the functionality of the API they implemented.
You may set up a separate sandbox environment to test the API proxy before pushing it to production. To deploy the API proxy to both the sandbox environment and the development environment, enter the test environment URL as the sandbox endpoint and the API backend URL as the endpoint.",178,"Title: REST API Proxy

REST API Proxy,Test the REST API Proxy,"Once you deploy your API, it is ready to be tested. Testing your REST API Proxy is an integral part of the spec-driven API development approach. Testing your API Proxy in Choreo can be done in 3 ways:
- Via the inbuilt OpenAPI Console
- Via cURL
- With a Postman integration

### In-built OpenAPI console
The in-built OpenAPI console is an interactive UI where you can test your API Proxy easily. You can test your APIs in the environments you deploy them in by selecting the environment. Choreo by default uses OAuth2.0 authentication. Therefore the OpenAPI console provides you the option to generate your test keys to test the APIs. Once you meet the pre-requisites, you can test the different resources you defined by specifying any parameters if needed. 

### cURL
Choreo provides you with a cURL command based on the resource, method, and environment you want to test your REST API Proxy. You need to select the environment, the methods, specify the base path of the resource, and any parameters. Once you provide the information to Choreo, it will generate a cURL command with an API key in place for you to test. 

### Postman
Choreo also allows you to integrate Postman. To integrate Postman, you need to create a postman account, generate an API Key from Postman, and include them in the Choreo UI. Once you integrate Postman successfully, you can import Postman workspaces, or create new workspaces and continue to test it on Choreo.

Summary: Testing a REST API Proxy in Choreo can be done in three ways: using an in-built OpenAPI console, cURL commands, and Postman integration. The OpenAPI console is an interactive UI with the option to generate authentication keys. The cURL commands are generated based on the environment, method, and resource specified. Postman integration requires an API Key to be set up and workspaces to be imported or created. Pre-requisites and parameters may need to be specified."
REST API Proxy,Manage the REST API Proxy,"API Management is automatically turned on in REST API Proxies (and other APIs) on Choreo. Converting an unmanaged API to a managed API is a key advantage of exposing REST API Proxies. Developers can use its capabilities to manage the exposure of APIs to their consumers. Developers can configure the API’s security settings, set rate limits, associate usage plans, provide other documentation, and perform other related functions to govern the API. 

### Lifecycle of a REST API Proxy
Once you implement a REST API Proxy, it needs to be built, tested, and eventually put into production. Choreo executes a CI/CD pipeline that manages the API’s Lifecycle. Choreo stores the source code of APIs in a private Github repository for the user account. It also provides the capability for developers to hook in their own Github repositories containing the source code of their APIs(coming soon). The CI/CD pipeline in Choreo takes an API through the whole process, starting with code checkout, to compile, build, test, and finally to deployment.

### Add documentation to the REST API Proxy
A well-designed API or API Proxy needs to be well-documented as well. The usability of the API/API Proxy is a deciding factor of its value. Many API developers find documenting an API a tedious task. Choreo makes documentation an easy task for developers by allowing different sources of documentation. Choreo allows you to add documentation to the REST API by specifying a URL, in Markdown format, importing a file, or by simply including inline documentation. 

### Usage Plans
The usage plan determines the number of requests allowed for the API per minute. Therefore, this is also the rate limit that applies to an API.

### Settings
A well-managed API needs to have security policies and access-control policies in place. Setting rate-limiting policies will ensure:
- Your API is protected from common types of security attacks such as certain types of Denial Of Service (DOS) attacks
- Traffic is regulated and the resources are not exhausted
In addition to providing different usage plans, Choreo also allows you to set different rate-limiting policies against the API or each resource. While the API level rate-limiting will impact the whole API, resource-level rate-limiting gives you the flexibility to change the rate-limiting policy per operation based on the anticipated or analyzed usage.
Choreo uses OAuth2.0 authentication.

Webhook,What is a webhook?,"A webhook is a cause that activates an action. Webhooks in Choreo are no different and are user-defined callbacks. 
Webhooks are used by developers to implement event-driven integrations. Before event-driven solutions,  to identify an event occurrence, systems had to keep polling other systems periodically.  With event-driven solutions, systems can focus on the main business-flow, and proactively be notified when an event of interest occurs in real-time. The following are some examples of scenarios where you can create webhooks for the mentioned platforms:
- Sending a chat message in a group chat when an event gets added in a slack channel.
- Generating an alert when a new issue gets created in a specific Git repository.
- Sending a notification when an event gets scheduled in a google calendar.
Webhooks are a widely used programming element to create event-driven API architectures for real-time solutions.",196,"Title: Webhook

Summary: Webhooks in Choreo are user-defined callbacks that are used by developers to create event-driven integrations. Instead of periodically polling other systems, webhooks allow systems to be notified of events of interest in real-time. Examples of using webhooks include sending chat messages in a group chat, generating alerts in a Git repository, and sending notifications when an event is scheduled in a Google Calendar. Webhooks are a popular way to create event-driven API architectures for real-time solutions."
Webhook,Develop a webhook,"Developing a webhook is the process of creating the webhook by identifying the trigger event and implementing the logic to execute the event. You can create and design an event-driven integration using webhooks in Choreo easily. 
Choreo’s low-code editor allows developers to easily design and develop webhooks for platforms such as GitHub, Slack, and Google Calendar, etc. using the integrated pro-code or low-code editor. Creating a webhook in Choreo starts by either creating the Webhook component from scratch or by connecting an existing Ballerina repository. To create a webhook from scratch, you can start by creating a Webhook component and selecting the trigger type(e.g. GitHub).
Next, you can give the webhook a name, select the trigger channel, and select whether to manage the webhook code in a choreo-managed repository or in your own repository. Once you have created your webhook, you can start developing the logic for the specific event(E.g. onOpened). Choreo will execute this logic when the webhook is activated. E.g. send an email when an issue gets created in GitHub. Additionally, you can define any configurations needed to run the webhook.

### Low code mode
The low-code programming model allows developers to use common programming constructs such as loops, conditions(if/else, variable declarations and assignments, logs, data transformations(visual data mapping), and much more in a graphical editor. It also allows developers to connect to any built-in or custom-developed connectors (https://central.ballerina.io).
Choreo allows you to add multiple triggers and channels to your webhook implementation via the low-code editor. It also shows the configurations needed to deploy the Webhook component. 
The main advantage of the low-code programming mode is that it increases the developer productivity by multiple folds by eliminating the need to write complex code. As developers use constructs on the low-code editor to implement the integration logic for the webhook, the IDE automatically writes the corresponding Ballerina (https://ballerina.io) source code of the webhook. This speeds up the developer's learning process significantly and thereby boosts overall productivity.

### Pro code mode
In addition to the low-code mode, Choreo provides a pro code mode of implementing the webhook's functionality with the ability to alternate between low-code and pro-code at any time. Choreo's online IDE allows viewing the low-code and pro-code editors side by side.
Choreo gives the developers the flexibility to use the pro-code mode only or use it for implementing certain parts of the API and use the low-code mode for the rest (based on their preference). Choreo treats the source code (generated and handwritten) of the API as the single source of truth and therefore has no limitations or restrictions on which mode developers may choose to implement their webhook's functionality.",622,"Title: Webhook

The pro-code mode gives developers the flexibility to use either mode for implementing the webhook's functionality. Choreo automatically writes the corresponding Ballerina source code of the webhook, which speeds up the development process."
Webhook,Deploy a webhook,"Choreo provides an easy, interactive UI to help you deploy the webhook in Choreo to the default development environment. On deployment, Choreo prompts to add the configuration values that the developer has configured.
Choreo runs a professional, enterprise-grade CI/CD process to deploy APIs to its runtime(data plane) clusters. Under the hood, Choreo’s data plane runs on a Kubernetes stack and hence benefits from all its features such as auto-scaling, auto-healing, secret management, liveness, readiness checks, etc. When you deploy a webhook, Choreo checks out your latest code, builds it, creates a Docker image, and starts it in a Kubernetes cluster managed by Choreo. At this point, Choreo also registers the webhook with the relevant event source (e.g., GitHub, Slack, etc.). When the relevant action occurs in the event source, Choreo is notified through the callback. Choreo then activates the webhook and fires events. Choreo exposes HTTP-based webhooks as an API. Therefore, you can test, manage, and observe this API like any other API on Choreo.
Once you deploy the webhooks to the development environment, it is active in the developer environment. When you are ready to take the code to production, you can promote the deployment and enable the functionality to your consumers. 
Choreo allows you to view the deployment logs through the Deploy view. This helps you troubleshoot and view the status of the builds and deployment. 

### Choreo environments
Choreo by default provides a development environment and a production environment in two separate Kubernetes clusters. Once you have deployed the Webhook component to the development environment and its functionality has been verified, developers can then promote their webhooks to the production environment:
Once you have promoted the Webhook component to production, Choreo then shows a second URL that developers can use in production applications to invoke the webhook.

Scheduled Tasks,Develop a scheduled task,"Developing a scheduled task refers to configuring an action to be executed.
!!! tip
    The development stage does not require you to specify the time interval at which the system needs to execute the action of the scheduled task. You need to provide it only when you deploy the Scheduled Task component.
e.g., If you need to schedule a health check log for an application, you may need to configure the following:
- How the Scheduled Task component gets the heartbeat of the application that it is monitoring
- The conditions based on which the Scheduled Task component can determine whether the application is healthy or not
- A log that indicates whether the application is healthy or not to the end-user
You can develop a scheduled task with such configurations in three possible ways.

### Start from scratch
You can design a scheduled task via Choreo’s low-code editor that allows developers to design scheduled tasks with ease. This method involves designing the scheduled tasks from scratch by manually specifying the resources, the HTTP verbs, paths, and other required elements. You can do so in the low-code view or the pro-code view.

#### Low-code view
The low-code programming model allows developers to use commonly known programming constructs such as loops, conditions(if/else, variable declarations and assignments), logs, data transformations(visual data mapping), etc., in a graphical editor. It also allows developers to connect to any built-in or custom-developed connectors.
The main advantage of the low-code programming view is that it increases developer productivity by multiple folds by eliminating the need to write complex code. As developers use constructs on the low-code editor to implement the integration logic for the scheduled task, the IDE automatically writes the corresponding Ballerina (https://ballerina.io) source code of the scheduled task, speeding up the developer's learning process significantly and boosting overall productivity.

#### Pro-code view
In addition to the low-code view, Choreo provides a pro-code view for implementing the functionality of a scheduled task. You can switch between the two flows at any time. Choreo's online IDE allows viewing the low-code and pro-code editors side-by-side.
Choreo gives the developers the flexibility to implement the complete scheduled task using the pro-code view or to use the pro-code view for only some parts of the implementation and then use the low-code view for the rest, based on their preference. Choreo treats the source code of the scheduled task as the single source of truth irrespective of whether it is auto-generated from the low-code implementation or written manually by the developer. Therefore, there are no limitations or restrictions on which view developers may choose to implement the functionality of the scheduled task.

### Connect existing Ballerina repository
If you have a scheduled task written in the Ballerina Programming Language (https://ballerina.io), you can deploy it in Choreo. To do this, you must save it in a private GitHub repository and connect that repository to Choreo.

### Bring your Dockerfile
If you have an existing scheduled task written in any programming language, you can deploy it in Choreo. To do this, you must generate a Docker image for the scheduled task and save the Dockerfile in a private GitHub repository. When you connect this GitHub repository to Choreo, you can build the Dockerfile to pull the scheduled task implementation from the Docker image.",725,"Title: Scheduled Tasks

GraphQL APIs,What is a GraphQL API?,"GraphQL (https://graphql.org) is a query language for APIs to fetch and persist data. A GraphQL API is a category of APIs that supports this query language.
A GraphQL API is an alternative for a REST API to address the following limitations experienced by REST API consumers:
- A REST API may need to send multiple requests to several endpoints to retrieve all the required data. A GraphQL API can achieve this via a single query. For example, a banking application has to fetch the phone number and the current account balance of an account holder. To achieve this, a REST API may need to send three requests to call three endpoints (e.g., `/customers/<id>` to fetch the initial data, `/customers/<id>/contactInfo` to fetch the phone number, and `/customers/<id>/balances` to fetch the current account balance).
    A GraphQL API can retrieve all these details via one query similar to the sample given below:
    ```
    query {
        customer (id: ""SIL182882762"") {
            contactInfo {
                phoneNo
            }
            balances(current)
        }
    }
    ```
    In this scenario, a single request by a REST API under-fetches data compared to a single request by a GraphQL API.
- In some scenarios, a REST API can over-fetch data. In the same example given above, a request sent by REST API to the `/customers/<id>/contactInfo` can result in fetching all the contact information in the array such as the phone number, work phone number, address, email, etc., whereas the application only needs the phone number. GraphQL allows you to avoid this by writing queries with specific data requirements.
GraphQL APIs consume fewer resources (such as internet bandwidth, system memory, etc.) by avoiding over-fetching and minimizing the number of requests it sends for a given purpose. Therefore, it is economical to consume GraphQL APIs instead of REST APIs for low-energy devices such as mobile devices.",518,"Title: GraphQL APIs

Forecast Performance Metrics,Use the Performance Analyzer,"You can use the Choreo Performance Analyzer on the Web Editor in low-code mode. 

### Analyze the performance-critical path in real-time
To view the real-time analysis of the performance-critical path of your component, follow the steps below:
1. Sign in to the Choreo Console at https://console.choreo.dev. 
2. Navigate to your component and click **Overview** from the left pane. 
3. Click **Edit Code** to access the Web Editor.

#### Overall performance of the performance-critical path
On the low-code editor, you will see a bar with the summarized overall performance estimates for each resource function. By default, this banner displays the forecasted latency and throughput when the indicated user count range executes the performance-critical path. The upper bound of the user count range is set based on the availability of historical data. Since the Performance Analyzer tool derives these metrics in real-time,  any changes to the component will update the metrics in real-time. 
By default, the Performance Analyzer tool does not highlight the performance-critical path in the low-code diagram. Click  **Reveal performance-critical path** on the top banner to highlight it in green in the low-code diagram.

#### Latency estimates for individual API invocations in the performance-critical path
The Performance Analyzer tool displays the estimated latency for each API invocation in the performance-critical path as a banner next to the API invocation in the low-code diagram, as shown below. The Performance Analyzer tool derives these estimates based on the user count range that is indicated on the low-code editor, as a bar with the summarized overall performance estimates for each resource function.

### Analyze the performance of all execution paths
By default, the Performance Analyzer tool does not highlight the performance-critical path in the low-code diagram. Click **Reveal performance-critical path** on the top banner to highlight it in green. A pane opens on the right of the Web Editor. You can perform an in-depth performance analysis of the component in this pane. 

#### Execution paths
You can view all execution paths in the component in a tabular format listed on top of the **Performance Forecast** pane. The table shows the entries in descending order based on the time it takes to process a single request in each path.
The Performance Analyzer tool identifies the execution paths using the service invocations performed by each of them. If an execution path does not include any service invocation, then the latency of that path is assumed to be negligible.
You can select any execution path from the table. When you select an execution path, the Performance Analyzer tool will highlight the execution path on the low-code diagram. The estimated overall performance values displayed on the top banner will change based on the execution path selected.

#### Performance forecast graphs
The performance forecast graphs: the latency graph and the throughput graph for the selected path of execution are below the **Execution Paths** table in the **Performance Forecast** pane. These performance forecast graphs forecast how the latency and throughput may vary based on the number of users simultaneously accessing the component.
By analyzing these graphs carefully, you can gain a fair understanding of how well your component will scale with the increasing load.",695,"Title: Forecast Performance Metrics

Policies,Policies,"Policies are units of business logic that a user can apply to slightly change the  `Request`, `Response`, or `Error` flow of an API invocation before reaching the backend or the client. For example, you can modify the response of an API invocation by adding a policy to the Response flow to transform the payload from JSON to  XML and to add a header in the response. 
Choreo includes a default set of policies covering most of the common use cases. You can attach one or more policies to the component implementation easily through the Choreo Console. Furthermore, you can attach multiple policies, swap, and rearrange them conveniently.
In Choreo, once you attach a mediation policy to a proxy, the deployment, internally, is a two-step process.
1. Deployment initiation.If the component to which you attached the mediation policy is new, the system creates and commits a new repository with the mediation service code based on the attached policies. This new service is referred to as the interceptor application. 
2. Deploying the API. Once the deployment initiation is complete, you can provide any configurations required and proceed to deploy. In this step, Choreo builds the generated interceptor application and pushes the Docker image to the Docker registry. Finally, Choreo deploys the interceptor application with the mediation service and the API Proxy.
 Depending on the flow to which the mediation policy is attached, the API invocation will undergo the respective behavioral modification as follows: 
 - In the request path, the requests that pass through the gateway reach the relevant component, and Choreo executes any attached policies to the resource's request path before sending it to the backend. 
- In the response path, the response messages from the backend are first received by the interceptor component, and Choreo executes any mediation policies attached to the `Response` flow or the `Error` flow. Then the response is forwarded to the client.
- In the event an error occurrs during the execution of policies or due to an internal error, the `Error` flow is executed and an error response is sent to the client.",440,"Title: Policies

If the error is due to a user error, for example, an error related to the API definition, etc., based on the logs the user can fix the issue and retrigger a build.

#### Build
The build stage builds the interceptor application as a Docker image and deploys it in the respective environment. For logs related to the build, you can refer build logs of both Ballerina and Docker.

Create a Policy,Implement the policy,"Let's implement a policy to validate an incoming header in the request and the response as follows:
- **Request path**: If the request header is not present or if the validation fails, let's log an error and return a 403 Bad Request response to the client.
- **Response path**: Let's log a message to indicate whether the request is valid or not.
To implement the policy, open the the `Policy.bal` file in the Ballerina project and fill in/modify the generated policy stubs(i.e., request, response, or fault).

### Best practices 
The following are some best practices and additional information you can refer to when implementing your policy:
- Organize the source within the default module of the package. Do not add any additional modules.
- A policy implementation can contain any combination of flows. A generated project contains stubs for all three flows: `Request`, `Response`, and `Fault`. You can remove any stub that you do not require. For example, when you create a policy that re-writes the resource paths, you can remove the `Response` and `fault` stubs. 
- The HTTP request/response objects and the context record that gets passed as parameters to the policy functions are passed as references. Therefore, the changes you make to these values are persisted and are passed through all other policies. The request and the response accumulate all the transformations done to them via the attached policies.
- The following return types of the policy functions(flows) is unmodifiable:
    - **http:Response** - Returns an HTTP response when you terminate the mediation flow prematurely. For example,  in the in-flow sequence, the mediation sequence terminates before calling the backend. The mediation policy then sends an HTTP response to the client.
    - **false** - Returns `false` if you want to terminate the mediation sequence with a pre-defined response(on the Choreo side).
    - **error** - Returns an error if you want to terminate the mediation flow and transfer control to the fault flow. The fault flow would then construct an error response and send it to the client.
    - **()** - Returns () to signal the successful completion of the policy. Once the proxy has completed executing the policy, it starts to execute the next policy in the sequence.",500,"Title: Create a Policy

Manage Applications,Grant types,"Choreo authentication is based on OAuth2.0. In OAuth 2.0, grant types are methods that allow client applications to obtain an access token depending on the type of the resource owner, the type of the application, and the trust relationship between the authorization server and the resource owner. 

### Refresh token grant
A refresh token is a token that you can use to get a new access token when your current access token is expired or when you need a new access token. You can use the refresh token grant type for this purpose. Issuing a refresh token is optional for the authorization server. If the authorization server issues a refresh token, it includes it in the response with the access token. You can use this refresh token and send it to the authorization server to obtain a new access token. Choreo's default authorization server, Asgardeo, issues refresh tokens for all other grant types other than the **client credentials** grant type, as recommended by the OAuth 2.0 specification.
!!! note
    - Keep your refresh token private, similar to the access token. 
    - The process to get a new access token using the Refresh Token grant type requires no user interaction.

### Token exchange grant 
Choreo supports the token exchange grant type. This grant type allows the client to obtain a Choreo access token by providing a JWT issued by an external IdP. The token exchange grant type uses the protocol defined in the OAuth 2.0 token exchange specification. The OAuth 2.0 token exchange specification describes how you can request and obtain security tokens from OAuth 2.0 authorization servers. 
To exchange a JWT issued by an external IdP for a Choreo access token, you must send a request to the Choreo token endpoint with the JWT in the request body. Upon successful authentication, validation of the request takes place, and the corresponding IdP configuration is retrieved using the issuer. Next, the subject token is validated. Successful validation generates and returns a Choreo access token.",428,"Title: Manage Applications
Heading: Grant types
Keywords: OAuth2.0, grant types, refresh token, client credentials, token exchange grant, JWT, IdP, token endpoint, issuer, subject token. 

Summary: Choreo authentication is based on OAuth2.0, which has different grant types: refresh token, client credentials, and token exchange grant. The refresh token grant is used to get a new access token when the current one is expired. The token exchange grant allows the client to use a JWT issued by an external IdP to obtain a Choreo access token. Upon successful authentication, the corresponding IdP configuration is retrieved, the subject token is validated, and a Choreo access token is generated and returned."
